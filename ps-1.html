      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="deep-dive">
        <p>
          In 2025, Internet fraud has evolved with advances in AI, deepfake technology, and the proliferation of dark web marketplaces. Both individuals and organizations face attacks that are harder to detect, more believable, and often originate from the <strong>hidden corners of the internet</strong> such as the dark web and deep web[3]. Understanding these threats and staying informed is essential.

      <div class="trend">
        <strong>AI-Driven Phishing & Deepfake Scams</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>AI generates near-perfect spear-phishing emails, voicemails, and even video calls impersonating legitimate contacts—tricking victims out of credentials or large wire transfers[2].</li>
